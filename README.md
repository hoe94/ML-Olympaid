# ML Olympaid

ML Olympaid 

It's a Kaggle Community Competitions hosted by ML GDEs or TensorFlow Malaysia User Group, sponsored by Google Developers. ML Ecosystem team from GDE sponsors swag prizes to winners of each competition. This is my first time to particapte the data hackathon event as I have often spent my time to build the portfolio projects.
With this participate expereince, I can leverage my machine learning knowledge to build the model. For the data hackathon, I will build the model based on training dataset, and test the model ability on testing dataset.

# Use Case

- Data Understanding
  * This is the transactions dataset that made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
  * It contains the information of transaction and paid amount made by credit cards
  * There's a target column to indicate whether the transaction is valid or fraud
  * Due to data security concern, all the data are encrypted
  
- Objective
  * To help company to capture the fraud transactions
  * To take action immediately on fraud transactions, and reduce the customer lost.

- Observation
  * The training data contains 227,845 rows data & 28 columns
  * The Training data is 48.7mb.
  * First 26 columns (col_0 - col_25) are the information about the transactions
  * Amount column is the paid amount made by transactions. Target column is the response varibale to indicate the transactions is valid or fraud
  * This training data is highly imbalanced. As the fraud transactions only take the distribution 0.17% (386 rows) among the datasets.
  * There are the missing values contains from first 26 columns (col_0 - col_25)

- Challenge
  * This dataset is highly unbalanaced. It might lead to read the prediction result incorrectly.
  * Due to confidental data, cant apply the business domain knowledge to analyse the data

- Methodology
  * Python package: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost
  * EDA Visualization: Histogram, Boxplot

# EDA Visualization

- Histogram
  * Based on the distribution & X-axis, we grouped our observation and categorize into the table

- Outlier Analysis
  * This analysis used to define any outlier valules occur on every column
  * From the boxplot chart, almost every column got outlier value are out of the range (min & max)
