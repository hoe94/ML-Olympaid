# ML Olympaid

ML Olympaid 

It's a Kaggle Community Competitions hosted by ML GDEs or TensorFlow Malaysia User Group, sponsored by Google Developers. ML Ecosystem team from GDE sponsors swag prizes to winners of each competition. This is my first time to particapte the data hackathon event as I have often spent my time to build the portfolio projects.
With this participate expereince, I can leverage my machine learning knowledge to build the model.
